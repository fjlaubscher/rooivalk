# Rooivalk
Rooivalk is a Discord bot that leverages OpenAI's API to generate responses when mentioned in a Discord server.<br/>
It is written in TypeScript and designed for easy customization and extension.

## Features
- **AI-powered responses**: Integrates with OpenAI for chat completions and image generation using gpt-image-1
- **Smart conversation handling**: Responds to mentions, replies to bot messages, and automatically creates threads
- **Thread management**: Automatic thread creation when users reply to bot messages, with full conversation continuity
- **Weather integration**: Fetches weather data from Yr.no for enhanced contextual responses and daily MOTD
- **Scheduled tasks**: Configurable MOTD (Message of the Day) and QOTD (Question of the Day) via cron jobs
- **Hot-reloadable configuration**: Runtime configuration updates via `config/*.md` files
- **Conversation context**: Full conversation history passed as context, including thread initial context preservation

## Setup

### Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v22 or newer recommended)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) (v10.x recommended)
- A Discord bot token ([guide](https://discord.com/developers/applications))
- An OpenAI API key ([guide](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys))
### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/fjlaubscher/rooivalk.git
   cd rooivalk
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pnpm install
   ```
3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following contents:
   ```env
   DISCORD_STARTUP_CHANNEL_ID=channelidforstartup
   DISCORD_MOTD_CHANNEL_ID=channelidformotd
   DISCORD_TOKEN=discord_app_token
   DISCORD_GUILD_ID=discord_server_id
   DISCORD_APP_ID=discord_app_id
   DISCORD_ALLOWED_APPS=comma,separated,app,ids
   OPENAI_API_KEY=openai_key
   OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14
   OPENAI_IMAGE_MODEL=gpt-image-1
   ROOIVALK_MOTD_CRON="0 8 * * *"
   ROOIVALK_QOTD_CRON="0 12 * * 3"
   ```
4. Start the bot (uses native TypeScript execution):
   ```sh
   pnpm start
   ```

### Detailed Project Structure

For a detailed breakdown of the project structure, please refer to [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md).

### Customization

The bot uses a modular service-based architecture. Each service has its own AGENTS.md file with specific guidance:

- **DiscordService** (`src/services/discord/`): Discord API integration and thread management
- **OpenAIService** (`src/services/openai/`): OpenAI API integration for chat and image generation
- **RooivalkService** (`src/services/rooivalk/`): Core business logic and message processing
- **YrService** (`src/services/yr/`): Weather data integration from Yr.no
- **CronService** (`src/services/cron/`): Scheduled tasks and background jobs

See [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md) for comprehensive architecture and development guidelines.

### Continuous Integration

This project uses GitHub Actions to automatically run tests and deploy the bot. The workflows are located in `.github/workflows/`:
- `test.yml`: Runs tests on every push and pull request to the `main` branch.
- `deploy.yml`: Handles deployment tasks.

No additional setup is requiredâ€”tests and deployments will run automatically if you push changes or open a pull request.

## Notes

- The codebase is written in modern TypeScript, using strict mode and modular architecture.
- All tests are written using [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/), and test utilities are provided for mocking Discord interactions.
